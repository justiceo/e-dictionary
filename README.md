### Install Locally

#### Chrome
1. Open chrome and navigate to extensions page using this URL: chrome://extensions.
2. Enable the "Developer mode".
3. Click "Load unpacked extension" button, browse the `build/chrome-dev` directory and select it.

### Firefox
1. Open firefox and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click the "Load Temporary Add-on" button.
3. Browse the `build/firefox-dev` directory and select the `manifest.json` file.


### Data Source considerations

* Tried https://dictionaryapi.dev/, it's based on low-quality wikitionary data.
* Consider Oxford and Merriam Webster, rate limit issues.
* Consider scraping definitions off of Google, this would be prone to breakage everytime their CSS rules changes (which happens often). 

### Screenshot example queries
* Phrase - a stitch in time saves nine.
* Non english word. 
* A colloquial term.
* Plural form.
* A rare english word with nouns and verbs etc. 

### Todo
* Do not show for text selections in editors (docs, medium, office in edit mode)
* Add screenshot for right click, popup, i18n
* Add support for inline-feedback.
